Quick web app that I made for a presentation. The aim of the web app is to generate shuffled gestures for the students to use while playing a gesture game.
## About the technologies
The web app was made in about an hour using React and TailwindCSS
## About the shuffle
Fisher-Yates algorithm was used for generating a random permutation of the objects.
